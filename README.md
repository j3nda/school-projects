    * alg1 - algorithms I
        This course is an introductory programming course. Students are expected
        general orientation in IT and high school mathematics. Discussed algorithms
        and data structures will be demonstrated in C + +. Considerable emphasis is
        placed on the practical implementation of the discussed algorithms and data
        structures. Students are encouraged to analyze the synthesis of algorithmic
        problems and solutions from smaller units.

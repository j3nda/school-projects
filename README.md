    2013/
        * dais/ ~ database and information systems
            The aim of the course is to provide students with a bachelor's degree
            extended information about database technologies with an emphasis
            the creation of an information system. Graduates will be able to implement
            an information system, which will have a nontrivial data layer and will use
            the capabilities of modern DBMS.

        * tamz1/ ~ Development of application for mobile devices I. (J2ME, Html5)
            To acquaint students with the basics of creating applications for mobile devices.
            After completing the course the student will be able to: 
            - To assess the suitability of the platform for the intended application 
            - Analyze, design and implement an application 
            - Compare the effectiveness of applications with applications written
              for the desktop 
            - Understand the importance of typical extension API and their use
            - Decide how to distribute the application on the target device
              and distinguish whether the application must be digitally signed.

        * tamz2/ ~ Development of application for mobile devices II. (Android SDK)
            To acquaint students with the advanced techniques of developing applications
            for mobile devices, especially mobile phones. 
            Technology Android, NET Compact Framework. After completing the course,
            students will be able to: 
            - Identify the application domain of mobile devices. 
            - Describe the procedures used in developing mobile applications. 
            - Distinguish the differences between platforms Android and CF 
            - Modify desktop applications for use on mobile platforms. 
            - Assess the real capabilities of the device due to project requirements.

    2012/
        * alg2/ ~ alhorithms II
            The aim of the course is to introduce students to object-oriented programming
            and develop students' knowledge in the area of data structures. After completing
            the course the student will be able to:
                analyze a given problem from the position of the PLO, create and debug
                a C + + program using OOP, use binary trees and hash tables,
                assess the effectiveness of the solution to the problem.

        * dvt/ ~ history of science and technology
            Get an overview of the development of new scientific knowledge and its
            relationship to the development of technology in the major industrial
            sectors, especially their own field of study.

        * lo/ ~ logic circuits
            The aim of the course is to acquaint students with the basics of digital
            systems with the perspective of the underlying hardware implementation
            with automatic gates and with a finite number of states, displaying numbers
            and symbols, basic algorithms for arithmetic operations in digital systems.

        * udbs/ ~ introduction to database systems
            The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the basic concepts
            of database technologies such as relational data model and the SQL language
            for defining, manipulating and querying data. After completing the course,
            students will be able to define a conceptual information system model,
            the relational schema and emphasis is placed on basic SQL commands according
            to the standard SQL92, which the student after completing the course control.

    2011/
        * alg1/ ~ algorithms I
            This course is an introductory programming course. Students are expected
            general orientation in IT and high school mathematics. Discussed algorithms
            and data structures will be demonstrated in C + +. Considerable emphasis is
            placed on the practical implementation of the discussed algorithms and data
            structures. Students are encouraged to analyze the synthesis of algorithmic
            problems and solutions from smaller units.

        * zp/ ~ introduction to programming
            The course aims to provide students with the basics of procedural programming
            and support for additional courses focusing detail on algorithms and programming
            languages. After the basics of programming, students will be able to:
                operate and utilize an integrated development environment for C / C + +,
                creating documentation not only to the source code, work in the university's
                school network to get acquainted with the tools for creating documentation.
            Besides the comparison of input knowledge of procedural programming C / C +
            + acquire a general overview important for subsequent studies.
